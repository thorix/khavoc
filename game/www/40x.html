<h1>404: Not Found</h1>
<p>This page doesn't exist. We're willing to bet that it's because you pasted in some dodgy URL that a "friend" of yours sent you.</p>
<p>We think that means you should really take stock of your life and the people in it. After all, friends don't send friends broken links. </p>

Either that or something really weird and/or bad happened on our end. I mean, I guess that's possible.
